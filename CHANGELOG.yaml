        Extra Go functionality organized like the Go's standard library.
  - versions:
      - version: v1.8.0
        date: 2024-01-24
        added:
          xtime:
            - Add `MiddayForDate` and `UTCMiddayForDate`
              Both functions do the same as `Midday` and `UTCMidday` respectively but for a specific date.
              The date is passed as year, month, day, just like Go's `time.Date()`.
      - version: v1.7.0
        date: 2023-12-11
        added:
          xtime:
            - Add `Midday` and `UTCMidday`
              The `Midday` function returns the current local time adjusted to midday (12:00 PM),
              while the `UTCMidday` function returns the current time in the UTC timezone, adjusted
              to midday. These functions are valuable for creating a standard timestamp where the
              specific time is not as significant as the date.
