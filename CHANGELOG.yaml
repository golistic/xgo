        Extra Go functionality organized like the Go's standard library.
  - versions:
      - version: v1.12.0
        date: 2024-06-25
        added:
          xslice:
            - RemoveFirst removes the first element from the given slice and returns the resulting slice.
              If the slice is empty, it returns an empty slice.
              RemoveFirstN removes the first "n" elements from the given slice and returns the resulting slice.
              If the slice is empty or "n" is larger than the length of the slice, it returns an empty slice
      - version: v1.11.0
        date: 2024-06-17
        added:
          xt:
            - Add `xt.ErrorIs()` to check a wrapped error. Also add the possibility to turn of
              colors in output of xt using the environmental variable `XT_NO_COLORS`. This is
              mostly to make testing easier, but can useful in other situations as well.
      - version: v1.10.0
        date: 2024-04-26
        added:
          xfs:
            - Add `xfs.IsDir` checking whether the argument is a directory within `fs.FS`.
          xptr:
            - `xptr.ValueOr` returns the first non-nil value. If the first argument is not nil,
              it is returned. Otherwise, the second argument is returned.
      - version: v1.9.0
        date: 2024-02-09
        added:
          xstring:
            - ScanTokens scans a string and returns a slice of tokens.
              Tokens are separated by whitespace, unless they are within quotes. If a token is within
              quotes, the whitespace is preserved within the token.
              Any character that is not whitespace or a quote is part of a token.
      - version: v1.8.0
        date: 2024-01-24
        added:
          xtime:
            - Add `MiddayForDate` and `UTCMiddayForDate`
              Both functions do the same as `Midday` and `UTCMidday` respectively but for a specific date.
              The date is passed as year, month, day, just like Go's `time.Date()`.
      - version: v1.7.0
        date: 2023-12-11
        added:
          xtime:
            - Add `Midday` and `UTCMidday`
              The `Midday` function returns the current local time adjusted to midday (12:00 PM),
              while the `UTCMidday` function returns the current time in the UTC timezone, adjusted
              to midday. These functions are valuable for creating a standard timestamp where the
              specific time is not as significant as the date.
